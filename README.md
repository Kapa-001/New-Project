# New-Project
H/w
PROJECT:
The project was to refactor a codebase to make it accessible for all search engines. It must contain semantic HTML elements,and they must follow a logical structure
independent of styling and positioning. Various images and icon elements in the code must contain an 'alt' elememt in it. Heading attributes fall in sequential order,
and title elements contain a concise, descriptive title. I started this project to understand the basics of coding, and how changing certain elements in a code can
change the outcome.
